## 29.1 Define drowning. 

Drowning is the process of experiencing **respiratory impairment** from submersion or immersion in liquid, leading to difficulty breathing. It can result in **survival with injury**, survival without injury, or **death**. Drowning occurs when water enters the airways, causing the body to struggle for oxygen and potentially leading to asphyxia.

## 29.2 Explain water-related emergencies.

Water-related emergencies include any situations where individuals are at risk of **injury or death due to incidents in or around water**. These emergencies can involve **drowning, near-drowning, hypothermia, and watercraft accidents**, and they often occur in swimming pools, oceans, lakes, rivers, or during activities such as boating and water sports. Common causes include **inability to swim, sudden waves or currents, entanglement, diving accidents, alcohol consumption, and lack of safety equipment**, requiring quick and effective rescue measures and immediate first aid to address potential injuries, breathing issues, or hypothermia.

## 29.3 Discuss spinal injuries in submersion incidents. 

Spinal injuries in submersion incidents typically occur when an individual’s head or neck collides with a hard surface, such as the bottom of a pool, rocks, or a diving board, often due to **diving accidents, falls, or high-impact water sports**. These injuries can result in **fractures, dislocations, or spinal cord damage**, which may lead to paralysis or loss of function, and are especially dangerous because they can cause **immobilization** in the water, increasing the risk of drowning. During rescue, it's crucial to **stabilize the head and neck** and minimize movement to prevent further spinal damage, using techniques like **in-water spinal stabilization** to safely extract the person without worsening the injury.

## 29.4 Explain swimmer’s ear, including assessment and care. 

### **Swimmer’s Ear (Otitis Externa)**:
Swimmer’s ear is an **infection of the outer ear canal**, caused by water that remains trapped in the ear after swimming, creating a moist environment that promotes **bacterial or fungal growth**. It often occurs due to prolonged exposure to water, frequent swimming, or inserting objects (like cotton swabs) into the ear that can damage the ear canal.

### **Assessment**:
- **Symptoms**: Look for **itching in the ear canal**, redness, pain (especially when the outer ear is pulled or pressed), and **discharge** from the ear that may be clear, yellow, or pus-like.
- **Examination**: Gently inspect the outer ear for **swelling or redness**, and ask the patient about symptoms like **reduced hearing, fullness in the ear**, or discomfort that worsens when the ear is touched.

### **Care**:
- **Keep the Ear Dry**: Advise the patient to avoid water exposure (e.g., swimming or showering without ear protection) until the infection clears.
- **Over-the-Counter Ear Drops**: Use **antibacterial or antifungal ear drops** as recommended by a healthcare provider, which may help reduce infection and inflammation.
- **Pain Management**: Over-the-counter **pain relievers** (like acetaminophen or ibuprofen) can be taken to alleviate discomfort.
- **Avoid Inserting Objects**: Do not insert cotton swabs, fingers, or other objects into the ear, as this can aggravate the infection or cause further damage.
- **Seek Medical Attention**: If symptoms **persist or worsen**, or if there is significant pain or fever, see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and prescription treatment.



## 29.5 Explain how to assess a patient with a water-related emergency.


Assessing a patient involved in a water-related emergency involves a systematic approach to quickly determine their condition and address any immediate life-threatening issues. Here’s how to conduct the assessment:

### **1. Ensure Scene Safety**
   - **Check the Environment**: Make sure the area is safe for you and the patient, and remove the patient from the water if it's safe to do so. Use **rescue equipment** if needed to avoid risking your own safety.

### **2. Initial Assessment (Primary Survey)**
   - **Check Responsiveness**: Determine if the patient is **conscious or unresponsive** by calling out to them and gently tapping.
   - **Airway**: Ensure the **airway is open and clear**. If the patient is unresponsive, carefully tilt the head back and lift the chin, but be cautious of possible spinal injuries.
   - **Breathing**: Look, listen, and feel for **normal breathing**. If there is no breathing, or only gasping, **begin rescue breathing** and consider **CPR**.
   - **Circulation**: Check for a **pulse**. If there is no pulse, start **CPR** immediately.

### **3. Check for Signs of Spinal Injury**
   - **Suspect Spinal Injury**: Assume a spinal injury if the patient was **diving, in a high-impact water crash, or found floating face down**, especially if they have bruising, neck pain, or numbness.
   - **Stabilize the Head and Neck**: If a spinal injury is suspected, manually **stabilize the head and neck** in a neutral position and avoid unnecessary movement during rescue.

### **4. Conduct a Detailed Physical Examination (Secondary Survey)**
   - **Check for Injuries**: Look for **cuts, bruises, fractures, and signs of trauma**, including to the head, neck, chest, and extremities.
   - **Look for Symptoms of Hypothermia**: Assess for **cold, pale skin, shivering, or confusion**, which could indicate hypothermia, especially if the patient has been in cold water.
   - **Assess Level of Consciousness**: Use the **AVPU scale** (Alert, Verbal, Pain, Unresponsive) to determine how responsive the patient is.
   - **Check for Signs of Near-Drowning**: Look for **coughing, foaming at the mouth, rapid or labored breathing, and cyanosis (bluish skin color)**, which can indicate water in the lungs or respiratory distress.

### **5. Monitor Vital Signs**
   - **Breathing and Pulse Rate**: Continuously monitor **breathing and pulse**, and be prepared to continue or initiate CPR if the patient stops breathing or loses their pulse.
   - **Temperature**: Monitor for signs of **hypothermia** if the patient has been in cold water.

### **6. Provide Immediate Care and Prepare for Transport**
   - **Begin Resuscitation if Necessary**: Start **rescue breaths, CPR, and defibrillation** (if an AED is available) as needed.
   - **Treat Hypothermia**: If the patient is showing signs of hypothermia, **remove wet clothing**, cover them with **warm blankets**, and avoid rapid warming. 
   - **Prepare for Medical Transport**: Ensure the patient is transported to a medical facility for further evaluation and care, as water-related emergencies may have delayed complications, such as **secondary drowning** or worsening hypothermia.

### Summary:
1. **Ensure Scene Safety**: Make sure the area is safe and remove the patient from the water if possible.
2. **Initial Assessment (Primary Survey)**: Check responsiveness, airway, breathing, and circulation; start CPR if needed.
3. **Check for Spinal Injury**: Stabilize the head and neck if a spinal injury is suspected.
4. **Detailed Physical Examination (Secondary Survey)**: Look for injuries, hypothermia, and symptoms of near-drowning.
5. **Monitor Vital Signs**: Continuously assess breathing, pulse, and temperature.
6. **Provide Care and Prepare for Transport**: Start resuscitation, treat hypothermia, and ensure the patient is taken to a medical facility for further care. 

Quick and thorough assessment can significantly improve outcomes in water-related emergencies by addressing life-threatening issues early and preparing for potential complications.
