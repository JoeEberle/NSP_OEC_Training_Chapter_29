<h2 id="291-define-drowning">29.1 Define drowning.</h2>
<p>Drowning is the process of experiencing <strong>respiratory impairment</strong> from submersion or immersion in liquid, leading to difficulty breathing. It can result in <strong>survival with injury</strong>, survival without injury, or <strong>death</strong>. Drowning occurs when water enters the airways, causing the body to struggle for oxygen and potentially leading to asphyxia.</p>
<h2 id="292-explain-water-related-emergencies">29.2 Explain water-related emergencies.</h2>
<p>Water-related emergencies include any situations where individuals are at risk of <strong>injury or death due to incidents in or around water</strong>. These emergencies can involve <strong>drowning, near-drowning, hypothermia, and watercraft accidents</strong>, and they often occur in swimming pools, oceans, lakes, rivers, or during activities such as boating and water sports. Common causes include <strong>inability to swim, sudden waves or currents, entanglement, diving accidents, alcohol consumption, and lack of safety equipment</strong>, requiring quick and effective rescue measures and immediate first aid to address potential injuries, breathing issues, or hypothermia.</p>
<h2 id="293-discuss-spinal-injuries-in-submersion-incidents">29.3 Discuss spinal injuries in submersion incidents.</h2>
<p>Spinal injuries in submersion incidents typically occur when an individual’s head or neck collides with a hard surface, such as the bottom of a pool, rocks, or a diving board, often due to <strong>diving accidents, falls, or high-impact water sports</strong>. These injuries can result in <strong>fractures, dislocations, or spinal cord damage</strong>, which may lead to paralysis or loss of function, and are especially dangerous because they can cause <strong>immobilization</strong> in the water, increasing the risk of drowning. During rescue, it's crucial to <strong>stabilize the head and neck</strong> and minimize movement to prevent further spinal damage, using techniques like <strong>in-water spinal stabilization</strong> to safely extract the person without worsening the injury.</p>
<h2 id="294-explain-swimmers-ear-including-assessment-and-care">29.4 Explain swimmer’s ear, including assessment and care.</h2>
<h3 id="swimmers-ear-otitis-externa"><strong>Swimmer’s Ear (Otitis Externa)</strong>:</h3>
<p>Swimmer’s ear is an <strong>infection of the outer ear canal</strong>, caused by water that remains trapped in the ear after swimming, creating a moist environment that promotes <strong>bacterial or fungal growth</strong>. It often occurs due to prolonged exposure to water, frequent swimming, or inserting objects (like cotton swabs) into the ear that can damage the ear canal.</p>
<h3 id="assessment"><strong>Assessment</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Look for <strong>itching in the ear canal</strong>, redness, pain (especially when the outer ear is pulled or pressed), and <strong>discharge</strong> from the ear that may be clear, yellow, or pus-like.</li>
<li><strong>Examination</strong>: Gently inspect the outer ear for <strong>swelling or redness</strong>, and ask the patient about symptoms like <strong>reduced hearing, fullness in the ear</strong>, or discomfort that worsens when the ear is touched.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="care"><strong>Care</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep the Ear Dry</strong>: Advise the patient to avoid water exposure (e.g., swimming or showering without ear protection) until the infection clears.</li>
<li><strong>Over-the-Counter Ear Drops</strong>: Use <strong>antibacterial or antifungal ear drops</strong> as recommended by a healthcare provider, which may help reduce infection and inflammation.</li>
<li><strong>Pain Management</strong>: Over-the-counter <strong>pain relievers</strong> (like acetaminophen or ibuprofen) can be taken to alleviate discomfort.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Inserting Objects</strong>: Do not insert cotton swabs, fingers, or other objects into the ear, as this can aggravate the infection or cause further damage.</li>
<li><strong>Seek Medical Attention</strong>: If symptoms <strong>persist or worsen</strong>, or if there is significant pain or fever, see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and prescription treatment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="295-explain-how-to-assess-a-patient-with-a-water-related-emergency">29.5 Explain how to assess a patient with a water-related emergency.</h2>
<p>Assessing a patient involved in a water-related emergency involves a systematic approach to quickly determine their condition and address any immediate life-threatening issues. Here’s how to conduct the assessment:</p>
<h3 id="1-ensure-scene-safety"><strong>1. Ensure Scene Safety</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check the Environment</strong>: Make sure the area is safe for you and the patient, and remove the patient from the water if it's safe to do so. Use <strong>rescue equipment</strong> if needed to avoid risking your own safety.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-initial-assessment-primary-survey"><strong>2. Initial Assessment (Primary Survey)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check Responsiveness</strong>: Determine if the patient is <strong>conscious or unresponsive</strong> by calling out to them and gently tapping.</li>
<li><strong>Airway</strong>: Ensure the <strong>airway is open and clear</strong>. If the patient is unresponsive, carefully tilt the head back and lift the chin, but be cautious of possible spinal injuries.</li>
<li><strong>Breathing</strong>: Look, listen, and feel for <strong>normal breathing</strong>. If there is no breathing, or only gasping, <strong>begin rescue breathing</strong> and consider <strong>CPR</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Circulation</strong>: Check for a <strong>pulse</strong>. If there is no pulse, start <strong>CPR</strong> immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-check-for-signs-of-spinal-injury"><strong>3. Check for Signs of Spinal Injury</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Suspect Spinal Injury</strong>: Assume a spinal injury if the patient was <strong>diving, in a high-impact water crash, or found floating face down</strong>, especially if they have bruising, neck pain, or numbness.</li>
<li><strong>Stabilize the Head and Neck</strong>: If a spinal injury is suspected, manually <strong>stabilize the head and neck</strong> in a neutral position and avoid unnecessary movement during rescue.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-conduct-a-detailed-physical-examination-secondary-survey"><strong>4. Conduct a Detailed Physical Examination (Secondary Survey)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check for Injuries</strong>: Look for <strong>cuts, bruises, fractures, and signs of trauma</strong>, including to the head, neck, chest, and extremities.</li>
<li><strong>Look for Symptoms of Hypothermia</strong>: Assess for <strong>cold, pale skin, shivering, or confusion</strong>, which could indicate hypothermia, especially if the patient has been in cold water.</li>
<li><strong>Assess Level of Consciousness</strong>: Use the <strong>AVPU scale</strong> (Alert, Verbal, Pain, Unresponsive) to determine how responsive the patient is.</li>
<li><strong>Check for Signs of Near-Drowning</strong>: Look for <strong>coughing, foaming at the mouth, rapid or labored breathing, and cyanosis (bluish skin color)</strong>, which can indicate water in the lungs or respiratory distress.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-monitor-vital-signs"><strong>5. Monitor Vital Signs</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breathing and Pulse Rate</strong>: Continuously monitor <strong>breathing and pulse</strong>, and be prepared to continue or initiate CPR if the patient stops breathing or loses their pulse.</li>
